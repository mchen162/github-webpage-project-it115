                         <h5>What to include:</h5>
                         <ul>
                             <li><strong>Current Work Samples</strong></li>
                             <p>Of course you want to have your best work on display, but it doesn't look good if your most recent sample is from several years ago.
                                 Make sure to keep your portfolio current and up to date.</p>

                             <li><strong>Who you are</strong></li>
                             <p>Including a bio section to let recruiters know who you are and what your skills, interests and plans are, 
                                 can help them see if you are a good potential candidate for their team.</p>
                                 
                             <li><strong>Education</strong></li>
                             <p>Including any degrees or certificates you have earned shows recruiters that you have the qualifications needed to fit the role.  
                                 Are you self-taught?  Include any online reputation you may have like your GitHub profile.</p>
                                 
                             <li><strong>Soft Skills</strong></li>
                             <p>Are you a critical thinker?  Are you a problem solver?  Are you a great organizer and team lead?  
                                 These are qualities that recruiters are looking for in new team members.  
                                 Make sure they know you have them! </p>

                             <p>It's good practice to have your first and last name in the URL of your portfolio.  
                                 If the domain is unavailable, you can also use your initials or add key words that describe your skills.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Tips and Tricks for Interviews</strong></h3>
                        <p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when you're preparing for a software engineering job interview:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>If you don't know the answer, just be honest:</strong></li>
                            <p>Developer interviews can get very technical, very fast. If you don’t know the answer to a question, be transparent and tell them that 
                            – but remind them that you’re excited to learn. You could even describe another skill that you learned on the last job (or taught yourself)
                            to demonstrate your initiative.</p>

                            <li><strong>Ask questions of your own:</strong></li>
                            <p>Great developers are in high demand. You might get more interview requests, or even competing job offers. So get all of the information 
                            you need to decide if the company is a good fit for you, too.</p>

                            <li><strong>Be ready to show off your portfolio:</strong></li>
                            <p>You should have a few of your best projects in one place, like GitHub. Even if you've never had a true developer job, there are other 
                            ways to build a portfolio -like starting your own passion project, or taking a project-based coding course.</p>
                        </ul><br><br>

                        <h3><strong>10 Common Questions and Answers</strong></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tell me about a tough software development problem and how you solved it.</strong></li>
                            <p>Give a brief description. Make the assumption the other person doesn’t know any specialized vocabulary or industry-specific challenges.
                            You can also ask the interviewer about their familiarity with the topic you’re about to describe and mold your answer based on the other 
                            person’s level of context (a more or less technical answer).</p><br>

                            <li><strong>Do you have any personal projects? Tell me about them.</strong></li>
                            <p>Sometimes it’s hard to settle on an idea for a project. If you have that problem, start by making a replica of a different application 
                            with a different tech stack or something. This will get your brain pumping and eventually you’ll come up with something you’d rather do. 
                            The key isn’t coming up with a great idea. The key is to get started on something.<br>After you’ve worked on your replica for a while, 
                            you might notice some shortcomings in the app that you can fix. Or you might realize that you don’t want to make this replica anymore and 
                            you start on something else. The purpose of replicating an existing app isn’t to really make the replica. The purpose is to get you started
                            on something so that you’ll find what you really want to do.</p><br>

                            <li><strong>Have you ever disagreed with your boss or manager? What did you do?</strong></li>
                            <p>Your goal is to share a story where you disagreed with your manager and you were right about the disagreement. The reason you want to be 
                            right is that your story should ideally show how competent you are at your work, which will give the hiring manager confidence in hiring you.
                            This answer can also display other great skills such as negotiating, selling an idea, and inspiring others.</p><br>

                            <li><strong>Why do you want to work at [company name]? Have you used our products?</strong></li>
                            <p>How can you help the company succeed? Read up on what’s happening with the company and its industry. What stage of growth is the business 
                            in? Has it recently changed its product or service offerings? What competitive pressures is it facing? Consider this landscape and think, 
                            “What knowledge and experience do I have that would be especially useful to this employer in this time of growth and/or change?”</p><br>

                            <li><strong>When do you consider a product to be finished?</strong></li>
                            <p>The process of software development is a never-ending cycle. The first release of a software application is rarely “finished.” There are 
                            almost always additional features and bug fixes waiting to be designed, developed, and deployed.<br> Reports from error monitoring software 
                            about usability and bugs feedback into the process of software development and become new feature requests and improvements to existing features.
                            </p><br>

                            <li><strong>Do you contribute to open source projects? Have you flagged issues?</strong></li>
                            <p>On this question, you’ll want to flag your passion for the open-source ecosystem, as a proxy for your passion for software engineering and your
                            ability to being proactive about contributing.</p><br>

                            <li><strong>How do you implement your error handling?</strong></li>
                            <p>Talk about writing tests, wrapping the code to catch exceptions, trying try/catch statements, and looking through the WOMM development process. 
                            Make sure that you have a well-thought-out answer to this question. </p><br>

                            <li><strong>Talk about a project you completed successfully.</strong></li>
                            <p>This gives you the chance to discuss a project without getting too technical. It should give the hiring manager an understanding of how you worked 
                            with teams, time management skills, interacted with managers, and what contributions you made to the project.</p><br>

                            <li><strong>What's important when checking a team member's code?</strong></li>
                            <p>While this question does not have a right or wrong answer it will give the hiring manager insight into your thought processes on coding. What are the
                            really important things when writing code? Do you focus on functionality or simplicity? Is security something you are concerned with?</p><br>

                            <li><strong>How did you solve a problem you faced?</strong></li>
                            <p>This question allows you to explain how you approach problems and your methodology for solving them. It will show whether you have the skills to hold up
                            to pressure and use your problem-solving skills to arrive at a solution. This does not have to be a software engineering problem, but it can.</p><br>
